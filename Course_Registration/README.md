The Course Registration app is a single-page HTML-Thymeleaf-Spring 
project. It allows users to input the first name, last name, e-mail address and phone number of a course participant. Upon 
confirmation, the app saves the information to the H2 database. The user 
input is shown line-by line on the same page.
