The Course Registration app is a tiny HTML-Thymeleaf-Spring 
project. It is a solo project made while attending the Helsinki University course "Server-Side Web 
Development Java" to further practice the concepts of the course. It can be run in Java IDE and 
while running, accessed at http://localhost:8080/. It allows the user to input the first name, last name, e-mail address and phone number of a course participant. 
Upon confirmation, the app saves the information to the database. The user input is shown line-by line on the same page.
