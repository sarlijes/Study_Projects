# Software Developer test

Publish your solution along with instructions to compile and run the solution on a public
code hosting site like GitHub or Bitbucket and send a link to the repository.

## Part I

Write a JavaScript-function that takes a string and prints its words, one per
line, in a rectangular frame. For example the string "Hello World in a frame"
gets printed as:

*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********

## Part II

Using [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/) or [Play framework](https://www.playframework.com/)
create a webservice endpoint that accepts the request described below and responds according
to the specification.

Request:

```
POST /hash
```

Request body:

```
{"text": "XXX"}
```

where the value of text is a string. 

Return a HTTP 200 response with a request body that contains the SHA-256 hash of the
value of text in a JSON object, as described below.

 Response body:
 
```
{"hash": "sha-256-hash-of-the-value-of-text"}
```

If the input is invalid return an error.
