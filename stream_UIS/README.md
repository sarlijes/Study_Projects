This is a solo project to practice reading data from a .csv file, mapping it to objects and to 
create a simple text-based UI to print the desired data from any available year. It is made 
when attending the Advanced Programming course (Helsinki University MOOC) to further practice reading larger files and using streams. The project can be run in the Java IDE of one's choice.

The .csv file is a random pick from the UIS Statistics website (http://data.uis.unesco.org/) and it shows 
the percentages of out-of-school rates for children of primary school age. Each country has either 
one or several rates for one or more years. Many countries have several rates for different 
stats (such as for two genders and one for both).
