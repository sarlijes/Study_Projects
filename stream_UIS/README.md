This is a project to practice reading data from a .csv file, mapping it to objects and to create a 
simple UI to print the desired data from any available year.

The .csv is a random pick from the UIS Statistics website (http://data.uis.unesco.org/) and it shows 
the percentages of out-of-school rates for children of primary school age. Each country has either 
one or several rates for one or more years. Many countries have several rates for different 
stats (such as for both genders and one for both).
